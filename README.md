# Greetings! 
This is a side project by me to try and revamp the unofficial BOTC icons. Just cuz we aint paid for Patreon dont mean our homebrew script images gotta be ruined by 1 tone art that stands out in a bad way cuz it dont fit the botc icon format. Currently i wanna prioritise the B3 scripts then move on to experimental but if you wanna help contribute you do whatever and ill make sure youre credited.

## Contributers
just me as of now


## How this shit is formatted
so you can see how theres a seperate icons folder despite there being folders for each edition? thats cuz the edition folders will have the icons post cropping so they fit on the unofficial tokens all flush and nice and the icons folder will have the raw image for viewing
