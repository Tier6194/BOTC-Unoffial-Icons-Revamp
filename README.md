# Greetings! 
This is a side project by me to try and revamp the unofficial BOTC icons. Just cuz we aint paid for Patreon dont mean our homebrew script images gotta be ruined by 1 tone art that stands out in a bad way cuz it dont fit the botc icon format. Currently i wanna prioritise the B3 scripts then move on to experimental but if you wanna help contribute you do whatever and ill make sure youre credited.

## Contributers
just me as of now
